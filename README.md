The first project based on *'Section 20: Building a Multi-Page SPA with React Router'* of Academind's *['React - The Complete Guide'](https://acad.link/reactjs)* course, this repo has commits of examples of:

* Adding a basic routing setup to display different components for different URLs, using the `<BrowserRouter>` and `<Route>` components - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/e36a12597fb4e7f79bb452bd5a01b6c2020ad434)
* Linking to the routes setup in the previous commit, using the `<Link>` component so that the page is NOT reloaded, and a new http request is NOT sent - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/ad8ceb360ad8def4fc9ba37c5a5c119fa61752a6)
* Replacing the `<Link>` component with the `<NavLink>` component to add a css class to whichever link is active (with the `activeClassName` prop) - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/1066278dfa2e6267ed3f94debce59e4143a6536f)
* Adding a dynamic route with params, and extracting the route params - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/468587b35a92d87b03156bdf9bb9cbc43e863bfb)
  * (although the params aren't really used here, just displayed on the page)
* Adding an example of how 'react-router' "matches" a URL to a path, and why you might be getting multiple components displaying for one route - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/7f8b50811dfcdcbb93adaf2df720ea86cc30f295)
* Adding the `<Switch>` component to allow only one route to be active at a time, and adding the `exact` prop to require an exact URL match with a `<Route>` path - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/48f0f855f81c78fa6eecd892c77981537d16b7cb)
* Adding a nested route - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/ff191108eb4c2c1eaec7977d5ddbde1c7461a47b)
* Using the `<Redirect>` component to redirect users - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-react-router-demo/commit/4ec9fd5671aaabe2233a126a15acddce89e364ae)
